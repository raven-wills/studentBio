    <p>Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me!
        Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. New-new-Doctor. You need to get
        yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the
        caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine
        with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. </p>

    <p>I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Aw, I wanted to be
        ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude.
        Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time
        War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost.
        They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.</p>
